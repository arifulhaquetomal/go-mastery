# 🧱 Go Foundations Project Pack

This repository contains **5 practical Go projects** designed to fully reinforce:

* **Arrays & Slices**
* **Maps**
* **Functions**
* **Error handling**
* **Control flow**

> **No advanced abstractions. Just strong fundamentals.**

## 🚀 1️⃣ CLI Student Grade Manager
**🎯 Objective**
Build a terminal-based application that adds students, stores scores, calculates averages, and finds the top performer.

**🧠 Topics Covered**
* `map[string][]int`
* Slice iteration & Aggregation (sum, average)
* Functions returning `(value, error)`
* Input validation logic

**🔥 Stretch Goals**
* Prevent duplicate students
* Compute class-wide average
* Sort students by average score

---

## 🧮 2️⃣ Expense Tracker
**🎯 Objective**
Build a simple expense tracking CLI to manage daily spending and identify high-cost days.

**🧠 Topics Covered**
* `map[string][]float64`
* Nested slice iteration
* Validating negative inputs
* Custom error returns & Defensive programming

**🔥 Stretch Goals**
* Monthly aggregation
* Category-based tracking
* Budget warning system

---

## 📂 3️⃣ File Word Counter
**🎯 Objective**
Create a program that reads a text file, counts total words, and tracks frequency.

**🧠 Topics Covered**
* File handling with error checks
* `map[string]int` frequency counting
* Converting maps to slices for sorting
* Case normalization

**🔥 Stretch Goals**
* Ignore punctuation
* Exclude stop words
* Export results to file

---

## 🎮 4️⃣ Mini Banking System
**🎯 Objective**
Simulate a banking backend: create accounts, deposit/withdraw money, and handle transfers.
