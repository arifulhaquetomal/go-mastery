🧱 Go Foundations Project Pack

This repository contains 5 practical Go projects designed to fully reinforce:

Arrays

Slices

Maps

Functions

Error handling

Control flow

No advanced abstractions. Just strong fundamentals.

Functions returning (value, error)

Handling empty slices

Error if student not found

Input validation logic

🔥 Stretch Goals

Prevent duplicate students

Compute class-wide average

Sort students by average score

Export summary to file

🧮 2️⃣ Expense Tracker
